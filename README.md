# Martina Dohnal - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Martina!ðŸ‘‹

I have a Master's degree in Economics (mag. oec.) and for the last 15 years I've been working in a financial management and implementation of European projects as a EU projects finance officer in State-owned enterprise.

For the last 2 years I'm thinking about making a career change to Data Analytics and **I decided this 2022. is going to be the year when I'm finally going to do it**. 

I've been working on technical and soft skills required to become a Data Analyst for some time and I'm ready to build portfolio of real-world projects demonstrating competency with key technologies, visualization and communication techniques, and the ability to translate information into recommended actions 

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress.
