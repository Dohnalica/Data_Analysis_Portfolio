# Martina Dohnal - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Martina! ðŸ‘‹

I have a Master's degree in Economics (mag. oec.) and for the last 15 years, I've been working in financial management and implementation of European projects as an EU projects finance officer in a State-owned enterprise.

For the last 2 years, I've been thinking about making a career change to Data Analytics and I decided this 2022. is going to be the year when I'm finally going to do it.

I've been working on technical and soft skills required to become a Data Analyst for some time and I'm ready to build a portfolio of real-world projects demonstrating competency with key technologies, visualization and communication techniques, and the ability to translate information into recommended actions.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress.
